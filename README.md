# INTRODUCTION 
## Story
***
> The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.

> Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten

> when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

> In one Age, called the Fourth Age by some,

> an Age long past, an Age yet to come, 

> a rough wind blew in the *Stedding*.

> The Wind was not *THE* beginning, 

> there are no beginnings nor endings to the turnings of the Wheel of Time; but it was *A* Beginning.
 
 ***

> The Third Age has ended. 

> Rand Al'Thor has won!

> Tarmon Gaidan has come and gone.

> The world is  safe from LeafBlighter.

> But *THIS* is not the **ONLY** world.

> The Ogier seek a new world; an old world; their homeworld. A world of peace. 

> A world they hope to find somewhere on the other end of Ways.

> Many have already left seeking it. 

> They have offered to take with them any human who will aid them and be their **SCOUTS** seeking this world of peace.

> A world that is pure *stedding*.

> But peace does not come without risk, without danger, without death. 

> Those who have chosen to become **SCOUTS** know this.

> Will you join them?
