The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.
Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

In one Age, called the Fourth Age by some, an Age long past, an Age yet to come, a rough wind blew in the *Stedding*.
The Wind was not *THE* beginning, there are not beginnings nor endings to the turnings of the Wheel of Time; but it was *A* Beginning.


The Third Age has ended. Rand Al'Thor has won! Tarmon Gaidan has come & gone. This world is now safe from LeafBlighter.
But it is not the **ONLY** world. The Ogier seek a new world; an old world. A world of peace. A world they hope to find somewhere on the other end of Ways.
Many of them have already left seeking it.  They have offered to take with them any human who will aid them and be their scouts to this world of peace.

A world that is pure *stedding*.

But peace does not come , without risk, without danger, without death. Those who have chosen to become *Scouts* know this. Will you join them?
